# Autopsy

dissect dead node service core dumps with mdb via a smart os vm

## About

![autopsy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nearform/autopsy/master/rec/autopsy.gif)

There is a Unix-like operating system called SmartOS whose 
ancestry represents a strong investment in low-level 
introspection tools (such as dtrace for instance).

Once such tool is `mdb`, a high quality modular debugger which
ships with SmartOS - it can be used to inspect execution
context from the kernel to application layers.

Some rather clever people wrote a debugging module called `mdb_v8` 
that allows introspection of node core dumps from a high level (e.g.
inspecting closure scope) to a low level (e.g. memory addresses).

It turns out that `mdb` can analyse Linux core files as well
as SmartOS core files. We just have provide the core file 
and the node binary that was running when the core dump was 
generated.

`autopsy` installs a a SmartOS VM and then acts as a 
stdio proxy to `mdb`.

For using mdb see the [mdb reference docs][]

## Prerequisites

* VirtualBox
* 2gb of RAM for VM
  * The VM runs entirely in RAM and mdb can be memory intensive also, 2gb is a safe bet

## Install

Install autopsy from npm:

```
npm install -g autopsy
```

Once finished the following executables will be available

* autopsy setup - runs setup
* autopsy start - starts the vm
* autopsy stop - stops the vm
* autopsy status - gets vm status
* autopsy ssh - use exactly as you would ssh, provides a tunnel from a server to locally installed vm
* autopsy - provides the CLI proxy to mdb in the vm

Next, set up the VM

### VM Setup

```
autopsy setup
```

This will install autopsy on the system, download smartos
virtual machine assets and setup a smartos vm in virtual box. 

Assets for the VM are ~150mb and downloads from S3.

If setup is interupted for any reason (including network failure
during assets download), simply try again. Partial downloads will
be resumed.

## Starting the VM

Before we can do an autopsy the VM needs to be running. 

Simply run

```
autopsy start
```

Autopsy takes a snapshot of the initial VM state on first run to
optimize subsequent boots, so the first `autopsy-start` will be 
the longest.

The VM runs SmartOS completely in ram (there are no zones).
This means VM state is immutable.

## Performing an autopsy

The `autopsy` command takes the following args

```sh
autopsy [node-binary] core-file
```

On OS X the node binary is not optional, on Linux
if not supplied the current installed node binary
will be used. 

When this command is run the following occurs

1. copy the node binary and core file into the vm (in a purpose built smartos zone)
2. ssh into the vm, login to the relevant smartos zone
3. run mdb with the copied core dump and node binary files
4. inject `::load v8` to get the v8 related debugging commands
5. pipe host machine process.stdin to the mdb interactive environment and pipe the mdb stdout to the host machine stdout

For using mdb see the [mdb reference docs][]

## Stopping the VM

When we're done we may wish to free memory by stopping the VM with

```
autopsy stop
```

## Example

The `example` folder has a `core` and `node` file that we're
generated by the `die.js` file 

You can try out autopsy with these two files (on OS X and 
Linux), from the same folder as this readme do

```
autopsy example/node example/core 
```

Once the mdb console appears you can try 

```
> ::jsstack
```

For starters, and then if you want to get fancy 

```
> ::findjsobjects -p myproperty
137289672551
> 137289672551::jsprint
```


## Autopsy on EC2 or in a VM

EC2 (and other VPS-type solutions) runs "machines" in virtualized containers, it's very
tricky to make a virtual machine run on a virtual machines, and even where it is possible
there is either an insufferable performance cost and/or certain low level features must
be enabled which risk of introducing security issues. That aside copying node, a core
file and using mdb all in a ram-only VM is memory intensive - not something we want to
do (or maybe even can do) on a production server.

But autopsy provides a way to do seamless postmortems on an EC2 server or any kind of 
linux VM - by setting up an SSH tunnel back to through the local machine and into the
SmartOS vm running locally.

This can be achieved in a few easy steps

1. install autopsy on local system and run autopsy setup, ensure its working locally
2. install autopsy within a VM or on an EC2 server (etc.)
3. ssh into the server in the same way as always, except prefix the command with `autopsy`, like so: 

```sh
autopsy ssh -i myKey.pem user@example.com
```

Simply use whatever `ssh` flags you normally would, and autopsy will additionally
set up the tunnelling (for the curious we inject the `-R` flag with the port of VM
mapped through to the same port on the server.)


## How to generate a core file

In production, if we run our node processes with `--abort-on-uncaught-exception` we will always get a core dump when a process crashes (that is, as long as our linux environment is set up correctly)

You can also manually generate a core file using `process.abort()`.

Finally a core file can also be obtained by attaching `gdb` to a running processing and executing `generate-core`. 

## Setting up Linux to generate core files

If you're using an ubuntu server (and probably debian etc. etc.) you may have apport installed - this intercepts core files so we need to get rid of it

```
sudo apt-get purge apport
```

Next you need to make sure that linux is configured to allocate
space for the core file, like so

```
ulimit -c unlimited
```

## Caveats

### Port 2222

The VM currently maps port 2222 to the port 22 (ssh), at the moment
is non-configurable - so to use autopsy port 2222 needs to be free on the
host system. 

### Removing the VM

Currently there's no command for removing the vm, follow these steps, in order

1. open virtual box, right click the vm, click remove - then click "delete all files"
2. rm the `assets` folder from the autopsy module folder `rm $(npm get prefix)/lib/node_modules/autopsy/assets`
3. make sure there isn't a smartos folder left in the virtual box virtual machines folder (`~/VirtualBox\ VMs`)

### Singleton VM - Run Globally

We recommend installing globally, since there can (currently) only be one
smartos vm. 

### Virtualbox Filesystem Coupling
If the smartos.iso file or any parent folder is moved/renamed
the vm will fail to start because virtualbox won't be able
to locate the the iso. In this case you would need to 
manually update virtual box with the paths.

## Debug Logs

For troubleshooting (or the curious), debugging can be turned 
on like so

```
DEBUG=autopsy:* <cmd>
```

At present the following commands have debug output

* autopsy
* autopsy setup
* autopsy start
